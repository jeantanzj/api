The objectives of the review are", "clear \u2013 to ensure that the institution of the Elected Presidency stays relevant with time and our", "local context, and that the Singapore Constitution as a living document is aptly refreshed. The", "Commission, comprising nine eminent and well-respected leaders in both the private and", "public sectors, took a consultative and inclusive approach in gathering ideas for its review.", "Many of these views of Singaporeans were thoughtful and constructive, and the Commission", "took them on board when it submitted its final report to the Government.", "During this sitting, Parliament will be debating the Constitutional Amendments to give effect", "to those changes accepted by the Government. To date, I have refrained from commenting", "publicly about the Commission\u2019s report or the Government\u2019s White Paper. There is no legal", "necessity for me to present my views on the proposals, nor is it in the Constitutional powers of", "the President to endorse or oppose any specific recommendations pertaining to the Elected", "Presidency.

But the Government has made", "it a practice to seek and consider the President\u2019s views when amending the Constitutional", "provisions which affect the President\u2019s discretionary powers, and to make known these views", "to Parliament when moving the Constitutional amendments. In this case, my five years as", "President have given me a personal perspective on the role of the Elected Presidency and how", "the Elected President serves the nation and all Singaporeans.

Based on how he carries himself or engages his", "counterparts, other countries will form a view on Singapore\u2019s position in the global", "community. Often, this requires the President to be well read, strategic in views and sensitive", "to geopolitical developments.", "The symbolic role of the President also extends domestically, with the President engaging the", "different communities and segments of Singaporeans. In my five years in office, it has been", "my personal mission to rally Singaporeans towards building a caring, cohesive and inclusive", "society. In Singapore, an important dimension of this role is working with the different ethnic", "groups that make up our multi-racial composition.", "It was not a coincidence that Singapore\u2019s first four appointed Presidents \u2013 Mr Yusof Ishak, Dr", "Benjamin Sheares, Mr Devan Nair and Dr Wee Kim Wee \u2013 represented, in turn, the Malay,", "Eurasian, Indian, and Chinese communities respectively.

Indeed, from my own experience, the scope and", "complexity of the Presidential oversight on Singapore\u2019s key assets have increased", "significantly, even in the span of five years of my term. My finance background was useful in", "helping me understand the technicalities of the Government\u2019s proposals, but the decisions", "often also require good policy acumen and a sound judgement on what is right for Singapore.", "I am therefore of the view that the Government\u2019s acceptance of the Commission\u2019s", "recommendations is in the right direction.", "Preventing Unconstructive Gridlocks", "I have spoken at length about the custodial role of the Elected Presidency.

In", "practice, up till today, the Presidents and the Council have worked well together. There has not", "been any need to subject any decision to the parliamentary override mechanism, because", "decisions have been well considered for the long-term good of Singapore.
